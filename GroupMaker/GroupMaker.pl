 Define your group of groups by using the Group Ids above and logic
 statements using AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses. Or, use MATCH() 
 or IMATCH() to select all the groups that match a regular expression. 
 (NOTE: MATCH() and IMATCH() can not be used with group numbers or 
 logic statements.)  When using MATCH & IMATCH, be sure
 to escape any special characters (pretty much anything that isn't
 a number or letter) with a backslash \ if they are a part of the 
 search string.

 Keep it simple. You can build more complex groups by making groups of 
 these groups.

=head1 NAME

GroupMaker - A script for creating groups of groups in Nexpose to create complex Asset Groups.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

perl GroupMaker.pl

perl GroupMaker.pl --user=myname --host=nexpose.acme.com --port 3780

perl GroupMaker.pl --rebuild --user=groupmaker --pass=gr0upm^k3r --host=nexpose.acme.com --port 3780 --rotate=100

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I wish Nexpose had the ability to create groups of groups. That is,
you might need a group that was everything in Group A, Group B, but
not in Group C. I wrote GroupMaker to address this need.

When you create groups with a script (using the API), you can only
create static groups.  Therefore GroupMaker creates static groups.
Once you create a group, its members stay the same until you change
the group.  To address this inability to create dynamic groups,
GroupMaker has a "rebuild" mode, which will recreate all the groups
you have saved. If you schedule GroupMaker to automatically run
in rebuild mode (perhaps daily), your groups won't be truly dynamic,
but they will at least be as current as the last time GroupMaker ran.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --rebuild 

Rebuilds all the groups that are set to Rebuild=On. It runs in a non-interactive manner. Therefore, you must also set user, pass, host, and port, either in the command line or by editing the script.
Rebuilding a group defined by MATCH or IMATCH will re-run the match, so if a group was added or deleted, results may change. Also, there is no easy way to predict the correct order to rebuild matches (if one matched group depends on another matched group), so results could be off.
Rebuilding a group defined by Group Ids will fail if one of the groups in the definition was deleted. The rebuilt group will have no devices.

You may wish to run with --rebuild before running interactively to make sure your groups are up to date.

GroupMaker analyzes the dependencies among groups of groups and rebuilds them in the proper order.  One exception: it does not yet do this for 
groups defined with MATCH or IMATCH.  I intend to fix that soon.

=item --logfile=filename.log 

Sets the log file to filename.log. By default, the logfile is "groupmaker.log"

=item --user=username 

Sets the username. You can edit the script to hard-code this if you wish.

=item --pass=password 

Sets the password. You can edit the script to hard-code this if you wish.

=item --host=hostname 

Sets the Nexpose host to connect to.  You can edit the script to hard-code this if you wish.

=item --port=port_number

Sets the port used by Nexpose (most systems use 3780).  You can edit the script to hard-code this if you wish.

=item --rotate=log_size 

Rotates any log files larger than log_size (in MB).  

The script uses a very simplistic log rotation: 

=over 4

=item (1) 

If a file exists with the same name as the logfile plus .old (eg groupmaker.log.old), delete it.

=item (2) 

If a file exists with the name of the logfile, rename it, adding .old to the end.

=back

If you need anything more sophisticated, write it yourself, or use an external tool to do it.

=item --man

=item --help

=head1 CREATING NEW GROUPS.

When you run GroupMaker interactively, you are guided through the process of creating a new
group.  First, you are presented with a list of all your current groups and their group ids.
It will look something like this: 

=over 4

 **************************************************************************
 * GroupMaker - please run GroupMaker.pl --man for complete info on use. *
 **************************************************************************

   Group Id     Group Name
   --------     --------------------------------------------------
    ( 3 )       A Group I Created
    ( 1 )       ALL ASSETS
    ( 2 )       Test Group

 Define your group of groups by using the Group Ids above and logic
 statements using AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses. Or, use MATCH()
 or IMATCH() to select all the groups that match a regular expression.
 (NOTE: MATCH() and IMATCH() can not be used with group numbers or
 logic statements.)  When using MATCH & IMATCH, be sure
 to escape any special characters (pretty much anything that isn't
 a number or letter) with a backslash  if they are a part of the
 search string.

 Keep it simple. You can build more complex groups by making groups of
 these groups.

At this point, you create a rule to define what your group will contain.

For example:

=over 4

=over 4

=item 1 OR 2 OR 3

This group will have everything from 1, 2, & 3

=item (1 OR 2 OR 3) AND NOT 4

This group will have everything from 1, 2, & 3, as long
as it is not in 4

=item 1 AND 2

This group will have everything that appears in both 1 & 2

=item MATCH(^teams)

This group will have everything that is in any group whose name begins
with "teams"

=item IMATCH(^teams)

Same as above, but case-independent.

=back

=back

Next, you are asked to provide a name for the group:

=over 4

 Now, provide the details about the group we're going to create.

 Group Name:

=back

Then, you are asked to enter a description for the group (this
is optional).

=over 4

 Description:

=back

Finally, you are asked whether you will want this group rebuilt
when you run GroupMaker with the --rebuild option.

=over 4

 Do you want to rebuild this group whenever GroupMaker is run with --rebuild?
 Please enter Yes, No, or Quit (y,n,q):

=back

If all goes well, you'll see a message indicating that your group was built,
and you're done!

=over 4

 Creating group My Sample Group...
 Group created successfully

=back

=head1 LOGGING

All results are logged to groupmaker.log unless overridden by --logfile. 

=head1 AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

NOTE: This script appears to need Nexpose full admin rights in order to rebuild groups. I believe this is a bug in Nexpose
and will report it. So, until this is resolved, it looks like you need to disregard the info below and run as an administrator, at least for rebuilding groups 

The account used to run this script SHOULD only need the following permissions in Nexpose:

Roles - set to custom:

=over 4

=item *

Manage Dynamic Asset Groups (this might not be necessary, but it ensures the user can access all sites)

=item *

Manage Static Asset Groups

=item *

View Group Asset Data

=item *

Manage Group Assets

=item *

Manage Asset Group Access

=back

Asset Group Access:

=over 4

=item *

Allow this user to access all asset groups

=back

Site Access:

=over 4

=item *

Allow this user to access all sites.

=back

If you automate this script, you should use an account that ONLY has these permissions. 
Avoid running the script as root or a nexpose administrator.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item Example 1: Everything in groups 1, 2, or 3

Lets say you have 3 groups, and you want a new group with everything in those groups.
You run GroupMaker, and see the group ids for those 3 groups are 1, 2, and 3. You
would create a group with the following rule:

=over 4

1 OR 2 OR 3

=back

Remember to use OR.  You want every device that is in group 1 or in 2 or in 3.  Don't
think "I want everything in 1 and 2 and 3."  That rule will give you only those assets
that appear in ALL three groups.

=item Example 2: Everything that is in both groups 1 and 2

If you want those items that appear in both groups 1 and 2, but not in only one or the
other, you would use AND:

=over 4

1 AND 2

=back

=item Example 3: All groups with "Team" in the name

In this example, let's assume you create dynamic asset groups for each team and have
a naming convention for these groups: each one begins with "Team" 
and the team name.  EG, "Team - Network" for all the network team's assets. If you
want a group of all the assets that have been assigned to a "Team" group, you could
run GroupMaker and create a group with the following rule:

=over 4

IMATCH(^team)

=back

imatch will do a case-insensitive match for the regular expression ^team.  The ^ is used
in regular expressions to indicate the start of a line.

=item Example 4: All assets that aren't assigned to a "Team" group

This example builds on the previous one. You need to find all the assets that haven't been
assigned to a team.  That is, you need all the assets that are not in a the group we created in 
Example 3.  For starters, you need a dynamic asset group that includes all assets.  Create that
in Nexpose.  (You might want to restrict it to assets that scanned in the last 30 or 90 days, 
so you aren't worrying about old systems.)  Lets call that group "All Assets", and the group from
Example 3 "All Teams."  When you run GroupMaker, it lists all your groups, and shows the group id's
(lets say "All Assets" = 10 and "All Teams" = 15).  To make a group that shows all assets that are not
in "All Teams", you would create a group with the following rule:

=over 4

10 AND NOT 15

=back

=back

=head1 INTERNALS

GroupMaker adds its own information to the group's description.  If you edit the
group within Nexpose, you will see that the description looks something like this:

=over 4

The description I entered (This group was created by the GroupMaker script. Rule='imatch(^team)'. Rebuild=On. First created: Tue Feb 12 16:02:13 2013. Rebuilt: Tue Feb 12 21:08:24 2013.)
 
=back

You can edit the description before and after the parenthesis however you want. Just don't
touch what is between the parenthesis, unless you want to mess up your group definitions!

=head1 RECOMMENDATIONS

=over 4

=item * Keep your logic simple.  
For complex groups, build simple groups, then
build groups of those groups.  That way, you can check the intermediate groups to 
see that they are what you expect.

=item * Look out for groups with 0 members.  There may have been an error when
rebuilding the group.

=item * Rebuilding

=over 4

=item - Set up a schedule (eg cron) to run --rebuild nightly or a few times a day.

=item - Always run --rotate when you run --rebuild

=item - Monitor your logs. Search for "ERROR". Better yet, ship the logs to a monitoring tool that will alert
if it sees ERROR.

=back

=back


=head1 CAVEATS

The script has not been tested on a system with only 1 existing asset group. It could fail
in such a situation.  (On the other hand, not sure how you would use it in such a case.)

The script assumes Nexpose enforces unique group names.  If two groups can have the same
name, this may fail.
